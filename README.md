### What I Learnt

This project was my first attempt at using alot of 3rd party libraries for my development as I used formik and yup for managing my form. I also learnt how and why it's better to write resuable components. Conclusively, i learnt how to use tailwind better and how to merge it with react to easily write conditional styling.
